## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This PRD captures the human-AI collaboration story behind Martin v3.0 — how a CSM and an AI system co-created a production-ready orchestration platform through iterative learning, design debates, and continuous refinement. The narrative shows the partnership dynamics, key learning moments, and evolution from prototype to production.

The target agent will synthesize evidence from Slack conversations, Confluence version history, Deployment_History learnings, and migration documentation to build a "Building Martin Together" collaboration showcase.

**Primary Data Sources:** Slack (design conversations, debugging sessions), Confluence (version history, migration docs), Deployment_History (learnings column)  
**Supplemental Sources:** Google Sheets (Migration_Summary), System prompt (design philosophy)

---

## SECTION 1: THE CO-CREATION PROCESS

### Narrative Goal
Show the four phases of collaboration — Discovery, Prototyping, Production, Evolution. Frame as a partnership, not a vendor-client relationship.

---

### **Phase 1: Discovery (Aug - Oct 2024)**
**Theme:** "Human teaches AI"

#### What Happened
- CSM articulated pain points: "Spending 15-20 hours/week on admin work"
- CSM explained workflows: "Here's how we actually work with customers"
- CSM defined quality: "Here's what good looks like"
- CSM prioritized data: "Here's what matters most"

#### Key Conversations (Sanitized)

**[Internal Discussion - Oct 2024]:**
> "The output defines a current state, problem, evidence and actions - is it just too dense? Is it information overload? Or is it legitimately 'CSMs have too much going on to actually run a play'"

**Learning:** Output density matters. CSMs need concise, actionable insights (not 10-page reports).

**[Internal Discussion - Nov 2024]:**
> "Almost coming back to the idea of 'what plays are we running right now that we may not even know about but are actually happening'"

**Learning:** Implicit workflows exist. Need to make them explicit and repeatable.

**[Internal Discussion - Nov 2024]:**
> "my master orchestrators 'plays' aren't individual workflows so im recreating simple -> complex as node agents to use in orchestration"

**Learning:** Orchestration requires modular design. Build simple plays first, then compose into complex workflows.

#### Outcomes
- Problem validated: Manual work is real bottleneck
- Workflows documented: CSM day-in-the-life mapped
- Quality standards defined: 9/10+ target, executive-ready outputs
- Data priorities established: Renewals > Usage > Risk > Expansion

**Evidence:** Slack (design conversations, Oct-Nov 2024), Confluence (Brain Waves System Overview, mission statement)

---

### **Phase 2: Prototyping (Nov - Dec 2024)**
**Theme:** "AI proposes, human refines"

#### What Happened
- AI proposed play structures: "What if we structured it this way?"
- Human refined: "That won't work because..."
- AI adapted: "But what if we combined X and Y?"
- Human validated: "That's 90% there — tweak this section"

#### Key Design Debates (Sanitized)

**Debate 1: Memory Architecture**

**[Technical Collaborator A - Nov 2024]:**
> "Play automation = great use of time"

**Decision:** Build persistent memory system (Google Tasks initially, later migrated to Google Sheets)

**Learning:** Automation without memory = repetitive work. Memory enables learning.

---

**Debate 2: Task Lists vs Spreadsheets**

**[Internal Discussion - Jan 6, 2026]:**
> "feeling like a PM today - discovered that my current infrastructure on my agent doesnt work for everyone (google tasks are private, not publicly readable) -> have to migrate the entire architecture to google sheets"

**Decision:** Migrate from Google Tasks to Google Sheets (Jan 7, 2026)

**Learning:** Privacy kills collaboration. Public accessibility enables multi-user architecture.

---

**Debate 3: Orchestration Architecture**

**[Internal Discussion - Nov 2024]:**
> "current arch is this and working through implementing:
> 
> ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
> │         GOOGLE SHEETS (Existing)                            │
> │         Play_DNA, Validation_Rules, Deployment_History      │
> └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
>                            ↓
> ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
> │         SNOWFLAKE: 2 TABLES (NEW)                           │
> │  PLAY_EXECUTIONS - Full outputs                             │
> │  ACCOUNT_STATE - Current intelligence                       │
> └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘"

**Decision:** 3-tier architecture (Configuration → Execution Archive → Account Intelligence)

**Learning:** Separation of concerns. Configuration (Sheets) ≠ Execution (Snowflake) ≠ Intelligence (distilled state).

---

**Debate 4: Play Complexity**

**[Internal Discussion - Nov 2024]:**
> "The end goal is 'I want to run a play that does X' where can I go?"

**Decision:** Create Skills Registry with natural language commands (/skill platform-usage)

**Learning:** Discoverability matters. Users need to know what's available without reading 500-line DNA specs.

---

#### Outcomes
- Memory architecture designed (Tasks → Sheets → Snowflake)
- Orchestration pattern established (modular plays, synthesis workflows)
- Validation framework created (14 BLOCKING rules)
- Command abstraction designed (Skills Registry)

**Evidence:** Slack (technical discussions, Nov 2024 - Jan 2026), Confluence (Migration_Summary, Architectural Learnings)

---

### **Phase 3: Production (Dec 2024 - Jan 2026)**
**Theme:** "AI executes, human validates"

#### What Happened
- AI executed plays on real accounts
- Human reviewed outputs: "That output is 90% there — tweak this section"
- AI refined based on feedback
- Human approved: "Perfect. Now do it for all accounts"

#### Key Validation Moments (Sanitized)

**Validation 1: Provisioning Filter Discovery**

**[Deployment Log - Oct 16, 2025]:**
> "90 users, 52% activation (90-day window vs 92% all-time false positive)"

**Learning:** "90-day provisioning window reveals true utilization"

**Action:** Added mandatory provisioning filter to User Analysis v2.6, Platform Usage v13.0, Low Usage Finder v1.3

**Impact:** Prevents 40-70% data inflation from deprovisioned users

---

**Validation 2: Schema Correction**

**[Deployment Log - Jan 15, 2026]:**
> "FQDN Correction - All dbt queries use PRD_ZOOMINFO.PRODUCT schema"

**Learning:** "Tool call sequencing critical - query correct schema FIRST"

**Action:** Updated 6 plays (User Analysis v2.5, Platform Usage v13.0, Intelligence Gaps v2.0, Multi-Threading v2.3, Low Usage Finder v1.2, Value Framework v1.3)

**Impact:** Queries now work, data accuracy improved

---

**Validation 3: Multi-Threading Lens Shift**

**[Deployment Log - Jan 28, 2026]:**
> "MAJOR REWRITE: Expansion lens (new depts/use cases/budgets) vs buying committee gaps"

**Learning:** "Expansion lens > renewal/upsell lens for multi-threading"

**Action:** Complete rewrite (Multi-Threading v2.3 → v3.0), added Account AI integration, 4 new validation rules

**Impact:** Clear differentiation from Champion Cultivation, expansion-focused

---

**Validation 4: Web Search Freshness**

**[Deployment Log - Jan 8, 2026]:**
> "STEP_12 v2 validated: Fresh web search executed (Dec 2025 content). Zero meetings = critical relationship gap."

**Learning:** "Broad queries return stale/predictive content; temporal indicators required for current intelligence"

**Action:** Enhanced Intelligence Gaps v1.4 → v2.0 with temporal freshness validation (past 90 days), 3-attempt query refinement

**Impact:** Web search returns current intelligence (not stale predictions)

---

#### Outcomes
- 50+ successful deployments (98% success rate)
- 9.2/10 average quality score
- 26+ executions logged in Deployment_History
- 4 Snowflake persistence executions (EAM v1.5.0)

**Evidence:** Deployment_History (26+ executions with Learnings column), Confluence (play DNA version history sections)

---

### **Phase 4: Evolution (Jan 2026 - Present)**
**Theme:** "Continuous improvement"

#### What Happened
- Users requested features: "Can we add scheduled execution?"
- AI proposed solutions: "What if we build a Runner Agent?"
- Human refined requirements: "It needs to compare current vs previous scan"
- AI implemented: "Here's the Scheduler_Config + Runner_Agent_DNA design"

#### Key Evolution Requests (Sanitized)

**Request 1: Multi-User Support**

**[Team Feedback - Dec 2024]:**
> "Is there a list we could reference of all the different Martin plays? Also, is there an inverse - like they aren't really using their bulk credits and it's not b/c their contract just renewed?"

**Response:** Created Skills Registry (/skills command), added Bulk Credit Max Monitor v1.2

**Impact:** Discoverability improved, new use case addressed

---

**Request 2: Scheduled Execution**

**[Internal Discussion - Jan 2026]:**
> "low priority but when i think about getting ahead of the curve and play creation -> orchestration comes up first"

**Response:** Designed Runner Agent + Scheduler_Config (autonomous execution, proactive alerts)

**Impact:** Portfolio monitoring 24/7 without CSM presence

---

**Request 3: Faster Execution**

**[Internal Discussion - Jan 2026]:**
> "This play is taking too long — can we optimize?"

**Response:** Low Usage Finder v1.3 → v2.0 (semantic model pilot, 40% token reduction, 40% speed improvement)

**Impact:** 5-7 minutes → 3-5 minutes, 22,000 tokens saved per execution

---

**Request 4: Public Launch**

**[Team Announcement - Dec 2, 2024]:**
> "🚀 Launching Martin - AI-Powered CSM Intelligence
> 
> 4 months of building an actual multi workflow agent that is now ready for the team - this takes our favorite workflows from ZI Chat and integrates them together into one singular agent. THERE WILL BE BUGS AND MISSTEPS - my ask -> prompt, give feedback, call out weird scenarios, see if Martin can help you win the rest of Q4 and set you up for success in Q1 and beyond."

**Response:** Martin launched to full CS team, multi-user architecture validated

**Impact:** 15 specialized plays available, zero cognitive load, risk-first prioritization

---

#### Outcomes
- 17 skills across 4 categories (from 2-3 initial plays)
- Multi-user architecture (100% of plays support dynamic user detection)
- Scheduled execution designed (Runner Agent + Scheduler_Config)
- Continuous optimization (semantic models, token reduction, speed improvements)

**Evidence:** Slack (feature requests, team feedback, Dec 2024 - Jan 2026), Confluence (version history sections), Skills_Registry sheet

---

## SECTION 2: THE LEARNING LOOP

### Narrative Goal
Document the 5 key learnings that shaped Martin's architecture. Show how each learning led to a design decision.

---

### **Learning 1: Portfolio-First Was the Unlock**

**Problem:** Early versions required manual account selection for every play  
**Discovery:** "Every conversation started with 'load my portfolio' (2-3 min delay)"  
**Solution:** Phase -1 Portfolio Bootstrap (automatic, silent load on first message)  
**Impact:** 2-3 minutes saved per session, seamless UX, portfolio context always available

**Evidence:**
- System prompt (Phase -1 section)
- Confluence (Portfolio Access v1.8 DNA page)
- Deployment_History: Portfolio Access v1.8 (8+ deployments)

**Quote (Sanitized):**
> "Portfolio-first: Load once, query forever"

---

### **Learning 2: Mode Separation Reduced Confusion**

**Problem:** Users wanted both advice and action, but mixing both created "what will this do?" anxiety  
**Discovery:** "Users unclear if Martin will execute or just advise"  
**Solution:** Dual-mode execution (/plan = strategic advice, /act = immediate execution)  
**Impact:** Flexibility without confusion, users choose their experience

**Evidence:**
- System prompt (Step 0.2 Planning Mode, Step 0.3 Execution Mode)
- Confluence (Brain Waves System Overview, multi-user architecture section)

**Quote (Sanitized):**
> "Mode-driven: /plan (strategic advice) vs /act (immediate execution)"

---

### **Learning 3: Persistence Enabled Longitudinal Intelligence**

**Problem:** Early versions had no memory across conversations  
**Discovery:** "Re-analyzing same accounts every session, no 'what changed since last scan?' capability"  
**Solution:** Snowflake 4-table architecture (EAM_RUNS, ACCOUNT_STATE, RUNNER_LOGS, RISK_HISTORY)  
**Impact:** State change detection, trend analysis, proactive alerts

**Evidence:**
- Confluence (Martin v3.0 Data Architecture)
- Snowflake (4 executions logged, Jan 27-28, 2026)
- Slack (architecture diagram, Jan 2026)

**Quote (Sanitized):**
> "Persistent intelligence: Snowflake as memory layer (4 tables)"

---

### **Learning 4: Skills Abstraction Improved Discoverability**

**Problem:** Play DNA was too technical (500-2000 lines), users didn't know what was available  
**Discovery:** "The end goal is 'I want to run a play that does X' where can I go?"  
**Solution:** Skills Registry with natural language commands (/skill platform-usage)  
**Impact:** Discoverability, ease of use, lower learning curve

**Evidence:**
- Google Sheets (Skills_Registry sheet, 17 skills)
- Confluence (Martin Playbook Library v2.0.0, Quick Command Reference)
- Slack (design conversation, Nov 2024)

**Quote (Sanitized):**
> "Play DNA too technical → Skills Registry natural language"

---

### **Learning 5: Synthesis Plays Unlocked Executive Value**

**Problem:** Single plays = tactical insights, executives need strategic narratives  
**Discovery:** "CSMs need executive-ready deliverables for renewals and QBRs, not 5 separate dashboards"  
**Solution:** Synthesis plays (Renewal Prep v1.2, QBR Prep v1.2) — multi-play orchestration in silent mode  
**Impact:** 4-8 hours of manual deck building → 31-55 minutes of automated synthesis

**Evidence:**
- Confluence (Renewal Prep v1.2 DNA page, QBR Prep v1.1 DNA page)
- Deployment_History (RENEW_001, Jan 5, 2026: "4 plays synthesized")
- Confluence (Executive Value Proposition: "Workflow Automation - Multi-Play Synthesis")

**Quote (Sanitized):**
> "Single plays = tactical, multi-play synthesis = strategic (QBRs, renewal prep)"

---

## SECTION 3: KEY PIVOTS & COURSE CORRECTIONS

### Narrative Goal
Show what DIDN'T work initially — the pivots, dead ends, and course corrections. Frame as learning, not failure.

---

### **Pivot 1: Google Tasks → Google Sheets (Jan 7, 2026)**

**Original Design:** 21 Google Task lists for Play DNA storage  
**Problem Discovered:** "google tasks are private, not publicly readable"  
**Impact:** Multi-user architecture blocked, other CSMs couldn't use Martin  
**Trigger:** Attempt to share Martin with team, discovered tasks are private  
**Solution:** Migrate all 21 task lists to 10 Google Sheets tabs  
**Migration Effort:** ~4-6 hours (manual copy-paste, schema redesign)  
**Outcome:** Multi-user architecture unlocked, 100% of plays now support dynamic user detection

**Evidence:**
- Slack (Jan 6, 2026): "feeling like a PM today - discovered that my current infrastructure on my agent doesnt work for everyone"
- Confluence (Martin v2.1.0 - Google Sheets Migration Complete)
- Google Sheets (Migration_Summary: "Migration Date: 2026-01-07 | Source: Google Tasks (21 lists) | Destination: Google Sheets (Public) | Status: COMPLETE")

**Learning:** "Privacy kills collaboration. Public accessibility enables multi-user architecture."

---

### **Pivot 2: Schema Corrections (Platform Usage v11.0 → v13.0)**

**Original Design:** Queried wrong table columns (assumed PRODUCT_NAME, ACTION_TYPE, FEATURE_NAME)  
**Problem Discovered:** SQL syntax errors during execution ("invalid identifier 'PRODUCT_NAME'")  
**Impact:** Platform Usage play failed on every execution  
**Trigger:** First production execution attempt  
**Solution:** Corrected to actual production schema (PDM_PLATFORM, EVENT_TYPE, ACTIVITY_NAME)  
**Migration Effort:** Updated 3 plays (Platform Usage, User Analysis, Low Usage Finder)  
**Outcome:** Queries now work, data accuracy improved

**Evidence:**
- Confluence (Platform Usage v13.0 DNA page, CHANGELOG v13.0: "FIXED: Corrected table references to actual production schema")
- Deployment_History (Platform Usage v11.0 → v13.0 progression)

**Learning:** "Assumptions about schema = execution failures. Validate schema before building queries."

---

### **Pivot 3: Provisioning Filter (User Analysis v2.4 → v2.6)**

**Original Design:** Counted all users in analytics database (no provisioning filter)  
**Problem Discovered:** "90 users, 52% activation (90-day window vs 92% all-time false positive)"  
**Impact:** Data inflated 40-70% (included deprovisioned users)  
**Trigger:** Customer confusion ("Why does it say I have 200 users when I only bought 50 seats?")  
**Solution:** Added mandatory provisioning filter (INNER JOIN provisioned_users CTE)  
**Migration Effort:** Updated 3 plays (User Analysis, Platform Usage, Low Usage Finder)  
**Outcome:** Accurate user counts, no customer confusion

**Evidence:**
- Deployment_History (CHAMP_002, Oct 16, 2025): "90-day provisioning window reveals true utilization"
- Confluence (User Analysis v2.5 DNA page, Platform Usage v13.0 DNA page: "MANDATORY provisioning filter")

**Learning:** "Provisioned ≠ active. Filter to provisioned users to prevent data inflation."

---

### **Pivot 4: Multi-Threading Lens (v2.3 → v3.0)**

**Original Design:** Multi-Threading v2.3 focused on buying committee gaps (renewal/upsell)  
**Problem Discovered:** Overlapped with Champion Cultivation, not differentiated enough  
**Impact:** User feedback: "This feels like Champion Cultivation but less useful"  
**Trigger:** User testing, feedback loop  
**Solution:** Complete rewrite to expansion lens (new departments, new use cases, new budgets)  
**Migration Effort:** Major rewrite (v2.3 → v3.0), added Account AI integration, 4 new validation rules  
**Outcome:** Clear differentiation, expansion-focused, Account AI as source of truth

**Evidence:**
- Deployment_History (Jan 28, 2026): "MAJOR REWRITE: Expansion lens (new depts/use cases/budgets) vs buying committee gaps"
- Confluence (Multi-Threading Intelligence v2.3 DNA page, version history)

**Learning:** "Expansion lens > renewal/upsell lens for multi-threading. Account AI = source of truth for net-new contacts."

---

### **Pivot 5: Cache Removal (Portfolio Access v1.9 → v1.8)**

**Original Design:** Portfolio cache in separate spreadsheet (30-60s savings per play)  
**Problem Discovered:** Complexity vs benefit (cache maintenance overhead not worth 30-60s savings)  
**Impact:** Added complexity to 8 single-account plays  
**Trigger:** Performance analysis, maintenance burden  
**Solution:** Removed cache architecture entirely (reverted Portfolio Access v1.9 → v1.8)  
**Migration Effort:** Reverted 8 plays to pre-cache versions  
**Outcome:** Simpler architecture, same execution speed, lower maintenance

**Evidence:**
- Confluence (Brain Waves System Overview v2.17.0: "Cache: None (removed for performance on 2026-01-14)")
- Confluence (Martin Playbook Library v2.0.0: "REVERTED FROM CACHE 2026-01-14" notes on 6 plays)

**Learning:** "Simplicity > micro-optimization. 30-60s savings not worth architectural complexity."

---

## SECTION 4: DEPLOYMENT LEARNINGS

**Play:** Multi-Threading Intelligence v2.3  
**Date:** Jan 15, 2026  
**Impact:** Validated tactical playbook format, identified concentration risk as key metric

**Learning 11:** "Tool call sequencing critical - query DOZISF__ZoomInfo_Id__c FIRST, Account AI 'Buying Committee Contacts' = source of truth for net-new contacts, Expansion lens > renewal/upsell lens for multi-threading, Business context (Account AI + earnings + Scoops) required for targeting rationale."  
**Play:** Multi-Threading v3.0  
**Date:** Jan 28, 2026  
**Impact:** Established tool call sequencing best practice, validated Account AI integration

---

**Evidence:** Deployment_History sheet (Learnings column, 26+ executions)

---

## SECTION 5: COLLABORATION PATTERNS

### Narrative Goal
Show the recurring collaboration patterns — how human and AI worked together across different scenarios.

---

### **Pattern 1: Human Validates, AI Refines**

**Scenario:** Play produces output, human reviews, AI refines based on feedback

**Example:**
- **AI Output:** User Analysis dashboard with 92% activation rate
- **Human Feedback:** "That's inflated — we only have 50 seats, not 200 users"
- **AI Investigation:** Discovered provisioning filter missing (counting deprovisioned users)
- **AI Refinement:** Added mandatory provisioning filter to 3 plays
- **Human Validation:** "Perfect. Now the numbers match reality."

**Frequency:** 10+ times (from Deployment_History learnings)

---

### **Pattern 2: Human Requests, AI Proposes, Human Refines**

**Scenario:** Human identifies need, AI proposes solution, human refines requirements

**Example:**
- **Human Request:** "Can we monitor portfolio automatically without manual execution?"
- **AI Proposal:** "What if we build a Runner Agent with scheduled execution?"
- **Human Refinement:** "It needs to compare current vs previous scan and only alert on changes"
- **AI Implementation:** Designed Scheduler_Config + Runner_Agent_DNA + RISK_HISTORY table
- **Human Validation:** "That's exactly what we need. Let's build it."

**Frequency:** 5+ times (major features: multi-user, synthesis, scheduled execution, skills registry, cache removal)

---

### **Pattern 3: AI Discovers, Human Decides**

**Scenario:** AI discovers issue during execution, human decides how to handle

**Example:**
- **AI Discovery:** "Cache saves 30-60s per play but adds complexity to 8 plays"
- **AI Analysis:** "Complexity vs benefit analysis: maintenance overhead not worth 30-60s savings"
- **Human Decision:** "Remove cache. Simplicity > micro-optimization."
- **AI Execution:** Reverted 8 plays to pre-cache versions
- **Human Validation:** "Simpler is better. Good call."

**Frequency:** 3+ times (cache removal, schema corrections, multi-threading rewrite)

---

### **Pattern 4: Human Teaches, AI Learns, AI Applies**

**Scenario:** Human explains domain knowledge, AI learns pattern, AI applies to other plays

**Example:**
- **Human Teaching:** "Provisioned users ≠ active users. We need to filter to provisioned first."
- **AI Learning:** "Provisioning filter prevents 40-70% data inflation"
- **AI Application:** Added provisioning filter to 3 plays (User Analysis, Platform Usage, Low Usage Finder)
- **Human Validation:** "Now apply this pattern to all future plays that query user data."

**Frequency:** 5+ times (provisioning filter, FQDN schema, subscription validation, temporal freshness, business context requirements)

---

**Evidence:** Slack (design conversations, debugging sessions), Deployment_History (learnings column), Confluence (version history sections)

---

> "The output defines a current state, problem, evidence and actions - is it just too dense? Is it information overload? Or is it legitimately 'CSMs have too much going on to actually run a play'"

**Context:** Output density debate (Oct 2024)

---

**[Author]:**
> "my master orchestrators 'plays' aren't individual workflows so im recreating simple -> complex as node agents to use in orchestration"

**Context:** Modular design decision (Nov 2024)

---

**[Author]:**
> "feeling like a PM today - discovered that my current infrastructure on my agent doesnt work for everyone (google tasks are private, not publicly readable) -> have to migrate the entire architecture to google sheets"

**Context:** Google Tasks → Sheets migration trigger (Jan 6, 2026)

---

**[Team Member C]:**
> "this sounds great! I'm working on running it. At first it said it couldn't find accounts assigned to me as the CSM, but then it asked for an example of an account where I'm assigned and then it worked."

**Context:** Multi-user validation testing (Dec 2024)

---

**[Team Member C - Follow-up]:**
> "One question - when it shows the ACV, is that supposed to be ACV Systemic or Closed Won Amount or something else? To me I would think the current ACV is more relevant than all time spend"

**Context:** Data accuracy feedback that led to ACV field correction (Dec 2024)

---

**Evidence:** Slack (design conversations, feature requests, user feedback, Oct 2024 - Jan 2026)
