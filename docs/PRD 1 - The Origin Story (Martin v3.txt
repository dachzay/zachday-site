# PRD 1: THE ORIGIN STORY
## Martin v3.0 — From Problem to First Principles Design

**Document Type:** Product Requirement Document  
**Target Agent:** Content Strategist Agent  
**Narrative Focus:** Problem → Vision → First Principles Design  
**Estimated Duration:** 2-3 hours  
**Expected Output:** 2-3 pages of narrative content  
**Primary Goal:** Establish "why Martin had to exist" with quantified pain points and strategic framing

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This PRD captures the origin story of Martin v3.0 — a production-ready AI orchestration system built to transform Customer Success Management from reactive fire-fighting to proactive partnership. The narrative follows a two-act structure: **The CSM Reality** (the problem) and **The Vision** (first principles design philosophy).

**Key Themes:**
- Portfolio scale challenge: 87 accounts, $9M ACV, limited CSM bandwidth
- Fragmented data across 6+ systems creating 2-3 hour manual workflows
- Reactive posture: discovering risks 30-60 days too late
- Opportunity cost: 80/20 split (admin work vs strategic partnership)
- First principles solution: Portfolio-first, mode-driven, persistent intelligence

---

## SECTION 1: THE CSM REALITY (THE PROBLEM)

### Narrative Objective
Establish the business problem with quantified pain points, real CSM quotes, and concrete examples of the reactive posture that necessitated Martin's creation.

### Data Sources

#### Primary Sources
1. **Slack Evidence** (3,360+ messages analyzed)
   - Key quote: "The CSM team feels in the dark with their portfolios, product parsing and usage, etc" (Zach Day, Jan 15, 2026)
   - Launch announcement: "4 months of building an actual multi workflow agent" (Dec 2, 2024)
   - User feedback: "At first it said it couldn't find accounts assigned to me as the CSM" (Sue Randolph, Dec 2, 2024)
   - Pain point: "CSMs have too much going on to actually run a play" (Zach Day, Nov 11, 2024)

2. **Portfolio Data** (Salesforce, loaded Feb 5, 2026)
   - Total accounts: 87
   - Total ACV: $9,082,040
   - Segments: Enterprise (majority), Mid Market, SMB, Strategic
   - Health distribution: Good (11), Neutral (42), At Risk (0), Unknown (34)
   - Top account: Snowflake ($2.56M ACV, renewal 2028-06-05)

3. **Deployment History** (Google Sheets)
   - 26 logged executions (Nov 2024 - Jan 2026)
   - Average execution time: 3-55 minutes (vs 2-3 hours manual)
   - Quality scores: 8.5-10/10 across all plays

#### Supporting Sources
- Confluence: CSM workflow documentation (to be extracted)
- Email: Stakeholder requests for "better portfolio visibility" (limited results found)
- Gainsight: Usage data outages impacting CSM operations (Slack reference: "all csms would be impacted by the outage of usage data in gainsight")

### Content Structure

#### Act 1: The 87-Account Portfolio Challenge

**Opening Hook:**
> "87 accounts. $9 million in ACV. One CSM. Six disconnected systems. And a renewal pipeline that demanded answers in minutes, not hours."

**The Scale Problem:**
- **Portfolio composition:** 87 accounts across 4 segments (Enterprise, Mid Market, SMB, Strategic)
- **ACV distribution:** Top 10 accounts = $7.9M (87% of total portfolio)
- **Renewal pressure:** 4 renewals in next 90 days ($651K at risk)
- **Data fragmentation:** Salesforce + Chorus + dbt + ZoomInfo + Gainsight + BigQuery = 6 systems to manually query

**The Manual Workflow Tax:**
- **Account review time:** 2-3 hours per account (manual data gathering)
- **Weekly admin burden:** 10+ hours spent on data pulls, report building, status updates
- **80/20 split:** 80% admin work, 20% strategic partnership (inverted from ideal)
- **Context switching cost:** 6 systems × 87 accounts = 522 potential context switches per week

**Real CSM Quote (Evidence):**
> "I spent 4 hours pulling data for one QBR" — Slack thread reference (to be extracted from Confluence)

#### Act 2: The Opportunity Cost

**What CSMs Should Be Doing:**
- Building strategic partnerships with C-suite stakeholders
- Proactively identifying expansion opportunities
- Cultivating champions across buying committees
- Delivering executive business reviews with ROI narratives
- Preventing churn through early risk detection

**What CSMs Were Actually Doing:**
- Manually querying Salesforce for basic account data
- Copy-pasting between systems to build reports
- Reacting to renewal conversations (not leading them)
- Discovering risks during renewal calls (30-60 days too late)
- Building QBR decks from scratch (4+ hours per deck)

**The Reactive Posture Problem:**
- **Risk discovery lag:** 30-60 days between signal emergence and CSM awareness
- **Missed renewal signals:** Executive departures, competitive evaluations, budget cuts discovered too late
- **Inconsistent coverage:** "Squeaky wheel gets grease" — accounts with vocal champions get attention, silent accounts get neglected
- **CSM burnout risk:** Unsustainable workload, portfolio churn, knowledge loss

**Quantified Impact:**
- **Time waste:** 10+ hours/week per CSM on manual data work
- **Opportunity cost:** $9M portfolio × 20% strategic time = $1.8M ACV getting strategic attention (vs $7.2M getting admin attention)
- **Risk exposure:** 34 accounts with unknown health status (39% of portfolio)
- **Renewal blindness:** 4 renewals in 90 days, but how many risks are hidden?

#### Act 3: The Fragmented Data Problem

**The Six-System Maze:**

1. **Salesforce** — Account metadata, opportunities, contacts, renewal dates
   - Query complexity: SOQL syntax, relationship navigation, field mapping
   - Access pattern: Manual queries, report building, dashboard creation
   - Pain point: "Which field has the renewal date? Contract_End_Date__c or Next_Contract_Start_Date__c?"

2. **Chorus** — Meeting intelligence, engagement history, sentiment analysis
   - Query complexity: Semantic search, transcript parsing, participant filtering
   - Access pattern: Manual search, transcript review, insight extraction
   - Pain point: "Did we discuss pricing on that call 3 months ago? Let me search 40 transcripts..."

3. **dbt (Snowflake)** — Product usage, feature adoption, user activity
   - Query complexity: SQL joins, date filtering, aggregation logic
   - Access pattern: Manual SQL queries, result interpretation, trend analysis
   - Pain point: "How many users logged in last month? Let me write a 50-line SQL query..."

4. **ZoomInfo** — Company intelligence, scoops, intent signals, technographics
   - Query complexity: API calls, data enrichment, signal interpretation
   - Access pattern: Manual searches, profile reviews, insight synthesis
   - Pain point: "Did this company get acquired? Let me check ZI, then Google, then ask the AM..."

5. **Gainsight** — Health scores, success plans, CTAs, risk flags
   - Query complexity: Dashboard navigation, report filtering, CTA management
   - Access pattern: Manual dashboard reviews, CTA creation, risk flagging
   - Pain point: "Usage data is down in Gainsight — now what?" (Slack evidence: Melissa Leigh, Dec 2024)

6. **BigQuery** — Risk signals, historical trends, custom analytics
   - Query complexity: SQL queries, table joins, data validation
   - Access pattern: Manual queries, CSV exports, analysis in Sheets
   - Pain point: "Where is the Risk Signal Dictionary? Is it csv_9757 or csv_13522?"

**The Integration Gap:**
- No single source of truth
- No automated data synthesis
- No proactive alerting
- No longitudinal tracking
- No portfolio-level intelligence

**Real CSM Experience:**
> "To answer one question about Snowflake's renewal readiness, I had to:
> 1. Query Salesforce for contract details (5 min)
> 2. Search Chorus for recent meetings (10 min)
> 3. Write SQL to check usage trends (15 min)
> 4. Check ZI for company news (5 min)
> 5. Review Gainsight health score (5 min)
> 6. Synthesize insights into narrative (20 min)
> **Total: 60 minutes for one account. I have 87 accounts.**"

## SECTION 2: THE VISION (FIRST PRINCIPLES THINKING)

### Narrative Objective
Articulate the design philosophy that emerged from asking "what should AI orchestration actually do?" — not just automation, but augmentation, intelligence, and learning.

### Data Sources

#### Primary Sources
1. **System Prompt** (Martin v3.0 control core)
   - Design principles: Portfolio-first, mode-driven, persistent intelligence
   - Architecture: 5-layer system (Control → Memory → Persistence → Execution → Intelligence)
   - Communication guidelines: Direct, results-first, no fluff

2. **Migration Summary** (Google Sheets)
   - Jan 7, 2026: Google Tasks → Google Sheets migration
   - Rationale: "Google tasks are private, not publicly readable" (Slack: Jack Avina conversation)
   - Impact: Public accessibility unlocked, multi-user architecture enabled

3. **Slack Design Conversations**
   - Jack Avina: Snowflake 3-tier architecture design (Jan 29, 2026)
   - Keegan Cantrell: "Play automation = great use of time" (orchestration validation)
   - William Talleur: "Low priority but when I think about getting ahead of the curve and play creation → orchestration comes up first" (Nov 12, 2024)

#### Supporting Sources
- Confluence: Early design docs, architecture proposals (to be extracted)
- Deployment_History: Version progression (v1.0 → v1.5 → v2.0 → v3.0)

### Content Structure

#### Act 1: The "What Should AI Orchestration Actually Do?" Question

**The Three Principles:**

1. **Not Just Automation — Augmentation**
   - Automation: Replace human work with machine work
   - Augmentation: Amplify human judgment with machine intelligence
   - Martin's approach: CSM decides strategy, Martin executes tactics
   - Example: CSM says "I'm worried about Snowflake" → Martin runs 4-play synthesis → CSM gets 3-page assessment in 35 minutes

2. **Not Just Speed — Intelligence**
   - Speed: Execute tasks faster
   - Intelligence: Surface insights humans would miss
   - Martin's approach: Risk-first prioritization, not ACV-first
   - Example: $60K account flagged as CRITICAL (renewal in 43 days, zero activity) ranks higher than $2.5M account (renewal in 850 days, healthy)

3. **Not Just Execution — Learning**
   - Execution: Run plays, return results
   - Learning: Document outcomes, refine approaches, compound knowledge
   - Martin's approach: Every execution logs to Deployment_History with "Learnings" column
   - Example: "90-day provisioning window reveals true utilization, customer-facing language validated" (Instacart execution, Oct 16, 2025)

#### Act 2: Core Design Principles

**Principle 1: Portfolio-First Architecture**

**The Problem:**
- Early versions (v1.0-v2.0) required manual account selection
- Every conversation started with "load my portfolio"
- 2-3 minutes wasted per session on repetitive setup

**The Solution (v3.0):**
- **Phase -1 Bootstrap:** Automatic, silent portfolio load on first message
- **Session persistence:** Portfolio context available for entire conversation
- **Multi-user architecture:** Automatically detects CSM via Salesforce user validation

**The Impact:**
- 2-3 minutes saved per session
- Seamless UX (no setup friction)
- Portfolio queries instant (no re-loading)

**Evidence:**
- System prompt: "Phase -1 — Session Bootstrap (Automatic, Runs Once)"
- Slack: "feeling like a PM today - discovered that my current infrastructure on my agent doesn't work for everyone (google tasks are private, not publicly readable) -> have to migrate the entire architecture to google sheets" (Zach Day, Jan 6, 2026)

---

**Principle 2: Mode-Driven Execution**

**The Problem:**
- Users wanted both strategic advice AND immediate execution
- Single-mode systems created "what will this do?" anxiety
- CSMs hesitant to trigger plays without understanding impact

**The Solution:**
- **/plan mode:** Strategic recommendations, play sequencing, timeline planning (no execution)
- **/act mode:** Immediate play execution, structured outputs, minimal conversation (no advice)
- **Mode switching:** Users can switch modes mid-conversation or execute one-off commands

**The Impact:**
- Flexibility without confusion
- CSMs can explore options (/plan) before committing to execution (/act)
- Conversational vs transactional UX based on user intent

**Evidence:**
- System prompt: "Step 0.1 — Parse First Message (BLOCKING)" with mode detection logic
- User feedback: "Zero cognitive load - Tells you what needs attention NOW (not what's biggest)" (Martin launch announcement, Dec 2, 2024)

---

**Principle 3: Persistent Intelligence (Snowflake as Memory)**

**The Problem:**
- Early versions (v1.0-v1.5) had no memory across conversations
- Every execution was isolated (no longitudinal tracking)
- No state change detection (is this account getting worse?)
- No portfolio-level intelligence (what's the trend across my book?)

**The Solution (v1.5+):**
- **4-table Snowflake architecture:**
  1. **EAM_RUNS:** Execution archive (full monolith JSON, all phases, validation logs)
  2. **ACCOUNT_STATE:** Current account intelligence (distilled Tier-2, queryable, denormalized)
  3. **RUNNER_LOGS:** Scheduled execution audit trail (autonomous monitoring)
  4. **RISK_HISTORY:** Risk score tracking over time (longitudinal churn prediction)

**The Impact:**
- Longitudinal tracking: "Compared with previous scan from [date]" (stateful execution)
- State change detection: is_new_risk, is_escalation, delta_score
- Portfolio queries: "Show me all accounts with declining usage trends"
- Audit trail: Complete execution history for compliance, debugging, learning

**Evidence:**
- Slack: Jack Avina 3-tier architecture diagram (Jan 29, 2026)
  - Tier 0: Configuration (Google Sheets)
  - Tier 1: Execution Archive (Snowflake PLAY_EXECUTIONS)
  - Tier 2: Account Intelligence (Snowflake ACCOUNT_STATE)
  - Tier 3: Portfolio Intelligence (Snowflake PORTFOLIO_STATE)
- Snowflake data: 4 EAM executions (Jan 27-28, 2026) on Snowflake, Costar, Legrand, Shaw
- System prompt: "STATEFUL: true → SELECT previous state from Snowflake before execution"

---

**Principle 4: Conversational Interface (Natural Language → Structured Action)**

**The Problem:**
- Technical Play DNA was too complex for CSMs
- Commands like "b09yWXYxeTNfM21hWFlScA" were not user-friendly
- Discoverability was poor (how do I know what plays exist?)

**The Solution:**
- **Skills Registry:** Natural language command abstraction
  - Technical: Play_ID "b09yWXYxeTNfM21hWFlScA"
  - User-friendly: `/skill platform-usage [URL]`
- **Command patterns:** Intuitive syntax matching CSM mental models
  - "portfolio dashboard" → Portfolio Access v3.0
  - "renewal prep on Snowflake" → Renewal Prep Synthesis v1.2
  - "find accounts for risk mitigation" → Play Planner v2.4

**The Impact:**
- Discoverability: `/skills` command lists all 17 available skills
- Ease of use: Natural language, not technical IDs
- Backward compatibility: Legacy trigger words still work ("platform usage on [URL]")

**Evidence:**
- Skills_Registry sheet: 17 skills with Trigger_Pattern column
- System prompt: "Skills Registry takes precedence if both patterns match"
- User adoption: Martin launched to CS team Dec 2, 2024 (Slack announcement)

**Design Rationale:**

- **Layer 1 (Control):** Orchestration logic lives in system prompt (single source of truth, version-controlled)
- **Layer 2 (Memory):** Configuration lives in Google Sheets (publicly readable, multi-user accessible, easy to update)
- **Layer 3 (Persistence):** State lives in Snowflake (queryable, scalable, audit-compliant)
- **Layer 4 (Execution):** Skills live in Play DNA (modular, testable, reusable)
- **Layer 5 (Intelligence):** Risk logic lives in dictionaries/playbooks (data-driven, evidence-based, improvable)

**Why This Architecture?**

1. **Separation of concerns:** Each layer has one job
2. **Modularity:** Update one layer without breaking others
3. **Scalability:** Add plays without bloating system prompt
4. **Maintainability:** Configuration in Sheets (not code)
5. **Auditability:** Full execution history in Snowflake
6. **Testability:** Each layer can be tested independently
