## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS

**Q: Do I need to read all 7 documents?**
A: No. Read the 2 most relevant to your role (see checklist above).

**Q: What if I'm confused about something?**
A: Check the document for your role. If not there, check 00_START_HERE.md.

**Q: Can I skip the reading and just start building?**
A: No. 30 minutes of reading saves 30 hours of rework. Trust the process.

**Q: What if something contradicts between documents?**
A: It shouldn't, but if it does, Martin_PRD_Template.md is authoritative.

**Q: Do we need to follow this exactly?**
A: For Phase 1, yes. For Phase 2+, use as a guide and adapt to what you learn.

**Q: When do we do Phase 2?**
A: After Phase 1 ships. See Martin_Future_Roadmap_18_Months.md for timing.

**Q: What if Phase 1 takes longer than 5 weeks?**
A: Flag it immediately. Better to extend phase than ship broken.

**Q: Can I peek at the code?**
A: No code yet. These are design docs. Code comes in Phase 1 build.
