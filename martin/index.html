  <h1>Martin</h1>
  <p class="meta">
    Martin is a personal AI system I built to turn messy inputs—notes, ideas, signals—into clear next actions.
  </p>
  <h2>The problem</h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Most work breaks down not because of a lack of information, but because context is scattered.
    Notes live in one place, signals in another, decisions in your head.
  </p>
  <p class="meta">
    Martin exists to reduce that friction—to help me think clearly, prioritize correctly,
    and move from ambiguity to action faster.
  </p>
  <h2>What Martin produces</h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Martin doesn’t generate ideas for me. It helps me decide what to do next.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Clear action plans</li>
    <li>Prioritized next steps</li>
    <li>Drafts I can actually send</li>
    <li>Summaries that reduce cognitive load</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How I use it</h2>
  <p class="meta">
    Martin is part of my daily workflow. I feed it raw context—notes, tasks, signals—
    and use its outputs as a thinking partner, not an authority.
  </p>
  <p class="meta">
    It’s designed to support judgment, not replace it.
  </p>
  <h2>What’s next</h2>
  <p class="meta">
    This page documents Martin at a high level.
    Over time, I’ll add deeper write-ups on how it works, what it’s made of,
    and what it’s taught me about building usable AI systems.
